# hangman-game

This is the third assignment for the Houston Coding Bootcamp Delivered by UT Austin.

HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript / Bootstrap Framework

Hangman Instructions:

To start playing just press a letter on the keyboard.
The word/phrase is diplayed on the screen as lines.
When a correct letter is selected it is displayed and logged onto the screen.
When an incorrect letter is selected nothing is displayed and also logged onto the screen.
You only have 7 incorrect guesses before losing the round. A counter is displayed to countdown to the next round.
If you correctly guess the word/phrase you win the round and a counter is displayed to countdown to the next round.
Your wins and losses are logged as your progress.

The theme of the game is Harry Potter.
This means that the words/phrases are also related to Harry Potter.

Give it a try and good luck!
